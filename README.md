The script uses BeautifulSoup to parse HTML content and extract details of events such as titles and times. It then formats this data into an .ics file format.

# Usage

Run the script from the command line by specifying the URL of the event page

```
python get_events.py "https://www.meetup.com/Your-Meetup-Group/events/"
```
